# Responsive Portfolio Website

## Demo Highlights ðŸŽ¥

## Getting Started ðŸš€
To recreate and run this website on your local machine follow these steps (I used VSC):

- Download on VSC the extenstion "Live Server"
- If you want to work on the code and need a autocompiler then use the extenstion "Sass (.sass only)"
#

Download the sourcecodes and have fun with it!

I'm a newbie in coding, so thats why I coded with help from a YouTube-Video from [Codehal](https://www.google.com).

This README is also just a test, so don't take it to seriously ;)
